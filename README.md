What is up fellas? This is my OFFICAL website, home to hundreds of songs I like just because I felt like making it I guess. You’ll find a ton of bangers here, plus even more bangers, along with quizzes, tests, YouTube links, and MP3 files for every track. Have fun exploring my library.

Changes that are W.I.P.
- Playlist Quiz (see how many songs you know)
- Playlist Tierlist (rank all the songs on preference)
- Full mp3 files for I-Z (coming soon)
- Chorus mp3 files for I-Z (coming soon)
- Alphebetical Search 
- Specific Song Search 
- Some Graphic Design Stuff (not very high priority)
- Highlighted Songs (means they are undeniable bangers)
- Songs for Q and X (😭😭)
